# StlyeGAN-Multi-Branches
This is a deprecated method for Huawei StyleMetaFace project. In this method, two branches, each consisting of 1 generator and 1 discriminator, are used for global UV maps and local UV maps, respectively. It is deprecated due to the lack of innovation and problem in encoder.
